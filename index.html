            <h1><span>Sami's</span> World!!</h1>
            <h3>A dream world of a beginner web developer</h3>
            <p>Sami is a business post graduate who completed his MBA in 2018 but sadly couldn't do anything with that
                degree. With a broken heart he decided to star a journey as a front end web developer.</p>

            <h1>Shoot for the <span>sky</span></h1>
            <h3>Sky has no limits</h3>
            <p>It took Sami a whole lot of time to realize that he can excel at whatever he puts his efforts into. And
                to him the most effort worthy task is to be a client side web developer.</p>
